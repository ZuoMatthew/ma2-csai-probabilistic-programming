\section{Implementation}
We have implemented the pipeline using python. Information about installation and usage can be found in \texttt{README.MD}.

Reporting of statistics other than the resulting probability only happens with our pipeline when MiniC2D is selected as model counter (flag --model\_counter minic2d).

\begin{itemize}
    \item Probabilities:
    \begin{lstlisting}
    cancer           : 0.01163

    pollution("high"): 0.1
    pollution("low") : 0.9
    smoker           : 0.3
    xray("negative") : 0.7918589999999999
