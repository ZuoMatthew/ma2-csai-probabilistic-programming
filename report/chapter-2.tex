\section{Implementation}
We have implemented the pipeline using python. Information about installation and usage can be found in \texttt{README.MD}.

Reporting of statistics other than the resulting probability only happens with our pipeline when MiniC2D is selected as model counter (flag --model_counter minic2d).

    \item Number of variables and lines in CNF:
    \item Depth of vtree:
    \item Number of edges and nodes in the circuit:
\end{itemize}
